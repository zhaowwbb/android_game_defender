This is my first Android game, it's very simple, I only spent several day, the main purpose is to practising Adroid programming skills, and it's also a fun to create a new game, I only done test on Sumsung galaxy 3, it only works on portrait mode.

How to play:
Tapping on the falling object can destroy that object, this is to protect the pumpkins at the bottom, once falling object hit pumpkin, the pumpkin will be killed, if you lose all pumpkins, game over. You can check game_screenshot.png to see what this game looks like.
